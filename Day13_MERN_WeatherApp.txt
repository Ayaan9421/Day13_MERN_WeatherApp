Project: Weather App
Tech Used: ReactJS, Axios, WeatherAPI, Geolocation API
Live Demo: https://day13-mern-weatherapp.web.app/
GitHub: [Add your repo link]

Built a Weather App that lets you:
	Search weather by city name
	Get weather via your device's GPS
	See real-time temperature, humidity, UV index, cloud %, wind, and more
	Visual feedback with weather icons
	Protected API key using .env file (no leaks!)


What I Learned:
How to use axios for fetching data from REST APIs
Securely manage API keys with .env in React apps
Use the Geolocation API to fetch current user location
Conditional rendering & handling API errors with toast
